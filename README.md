> In this project, I built a Python deep learning model with LSTM to predict the future behavior of Petrobras stock prices. Based on the historical daily prices of Petrobras stocks from 2013 to 2018, the model predicts the opening prices of 2019.

## 1. Overview 
The purpose of this project was to get started forecasting time series with LSTM models. I used a tutorial from [Derrick Mwiti]( https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/11/keras-long-short-term-memory-lstm-model-predict-stock-prices.html). Stock market data is a great choice for this because it’s quite regular and widely available to everyone.	
Using a Keras Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Model to Predict Stock Prices. LSTMs are very powerful in sequence prediction problems because they're able to store past information. This is important here because the previous price of a stock is crucial in predicting its future price. 

## 2. Quick Start  
[Checkout](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/alicevillar/stock_market_prediction_lstm/blob/main/Untitled.ipynb) a static version of the notebook with Jupyter NBViewer from the comfort of your web browser.

## 3. How does LSTM works?
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a type of recurrent neural network capable of learning order dependence in sequence prediction problems. LSTMs have feedback connections, which enables it to process entire sequences of data (e.g. time series). Rather than treating each point in the sequence independently, LSTMs retains useful information about previous data in the sequence to help with the processing of new data points. As a result, LSTMs are particularly good at processing sequences of data such as text, speech and general time-series.

## 4. Dataset  
For this project I used the [Yahoo Finance]( https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PBR?p=PBR&.tsrc=fin-srch) for the historical daily prices of Petrobras stocks.
- [Training dataset](https://github.com/alicevillar/ltsm_petrobras/blob/main/dataset_2012_2018.csv): historical daily prices of Petrobras stocks from 2012 to 2018
- [Test dataset](https://github.com/alicevillar/ltsm_petrobras/blob/main/dataset_2019.csv): historical daily prices of Petrobras stocks of 2019
